This add-on allows users to perform object detection on an image element present on their screen. The result is presented as a sentence of the form "The image contains a `x`, `y's` and a `z`".

Detection is triggered by pressing Alt+NVDA+D. When the detection is complete, "Result Document" is announced. Users can then access the result as a navigator object by pressing CTRL+arrow keys. Press ESC to escape the result.
